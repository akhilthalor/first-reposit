# first-reposit

first edit etc.

So, reverted the changes done by this branch on master, deleted this branch and then restored this branch again to make the same changes again.

So, I have created myfirst branch and uploaded a simple front-end project, still unsure whether it will work or not.

Project Name = Login Portal.


It's a static website containing the element just for a show , how a login portal will look like.
It uses a bootstrap 4 framework.
It's a one page only that is it will not lead you to any other pages when clicked on buttons or links.
So, here it is my first tiny project.
